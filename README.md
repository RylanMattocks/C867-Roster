# C867-Roster
This project outputs into the console an array of students and then allows printing of additonal information and make changes to the array. The methods in the project allow for: checking for valid email addresses, outputting the average days in their courses, outputting students with a particular degree, removing a student, and outputting the new roster to check if changes were committed.
